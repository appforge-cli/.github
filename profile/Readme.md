## What We Do

We build developer tools that eliminate the boring setup work and get you straight to building features. Our flagship tool, **AppForge CLI**, generates production-ready Flutter applications with everything you need already configured—authentication, theming, Firebase integration, and a clean architecture.

No more spending hours setting up the same boilerplate. Just run one command and start building what matters.

## 📦 Our Projects

### [AppForge CLI](https://github.com/appforge-cli/appforge_cli)
A powerful command-line tool for generating Flutter apps with:
- 5 beautiful pre-built themes with light/dark mode
- Multiple auth methods (Email, Phone/OTP, Social)
- Modular Firebase integration (Auth, Firestore, Storage, FCM)
- 12+ production-ready reusable widgets
- Clean architecture with your choice of state management
- Responsive screens ready to customize

**Quick Start:**
```bash
dart pub global activate appforge_cli
appforge create
```

📊 **100+ downloads in the first week** | [View on pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/appforge_cli)

## 🎯 Our Mission

We're developers who got tired of repeating the same setup tasks for every new Flutter project. So we built the tool we wish we had one that handles the tedious stuff so you can focus on building something great.

Whether you're prototyping an idea over the weekend or starting a production app, AppForge gets you from zero to coding in minutes, not hours.
